###### Prompt for converting raw transcript into actionable actions ######


## Example Conversation Transcript:
example_transcript = """
**Boss:** *Morning, Alex. I’m back. Catch me up—what do I need to know?*  

**PA:** *Good morning! Hope the PTO was good. A few things to go over—biggest one first: there was an incident while you were out.*  

**Boss:** *Of course there was. What happened?*  

**PA:** *Last Monday, around 10 AM, the authentication service went down—users couldn’t log in. It took about a day to fully resolve. There was a rollback, then a hotfix, and now everything is stable. The postmortem is in Slack if you want to skim it.*  

**Boss:** *Got it. Who handled it?*  

**PA:** *Mostly DevOps—Mark and Priya led the response, and Charlie from backend pushed the hotfix. They did a solid job keeping it contained.*  

**Boss:** *Alright, I’ll ping them later. Anything I need to sign off on?*  

**PA:** *Yes—there are three PRs in GitHub waiting for your approval. Two are related to the incident—fixes and logging improvements. The third is the feature work for the new API rate-limiting, which was already in progress before the incident. I’ve left comments summarizing the changes.*  

**Boss:** *Appreciate it. I’ll review those this morning. What else?*  

**PA:** *You’ve got a backlog of Slack messages. Most are noise, but I flagged a few—one from the VP of Engineering checking in about the outage, another from Product about timeline adjustments for the upcoming release.*  

**Boss:** *Okay, I’ll respond to those first. Emails?*  

**PA:** *Nothing too urgent, but a couple of things stand out: Legal sent a request for input on an upcoming compliance review, and Finance wants estimates for next quarter’s cloud spend. I’ve drafted responses if you want to tweak them.*  

**Boss:** *Perfect, send them over. Anything else?*  

**PA:** *Just a reminder—your one-on-one with Priya is at 3 PM. Might be good to check in on the postmortem with her.*  

**Boss:** *Good call. Alright, thanks, Alex. I’ll tackle these now.*  

**PA:** *No problem! Let me know if you need anything.*

Extra Context:


Slack Messages:
Monday – 10:05 AM

Mark (DevOps) [10:05 AM]: Getting reports that users can’t log in. Checking logs now.

Charlie (Backend) [10:07 AM]: Seeing a spike in 500s from the authentication service. Looks like a database connection issue?

Priya (SRE) [10:08 AM]: Monitoring dashboards. Requests are piling up, latency is increasing significantly. Something is definitely off.

Samantha (Product) [10:10 AM]: Customer support is receiving multiple tickets. Users are locked out across all regions. Do we have an estimated time for resolution?

Mark (DevOps) [10:12 AM]: Rolling back the latest authentication service deployment. This might be related.

Monday – 10:30 AM

Charlie (Backend) [10:30 AM]: Rollback did not fix the issue. The problem persists.

Priya (SRE) [10:32 AM]: Confirming that database connections are maxed out. Seeing timeouts in the connection pool.

Mark (DevOps) [10:35 AM]: Could this be related to last week's infrastructure changes? We updated how the authentication service handles connection retries.

Samantha (Product) [10:40 AM]: The VP of Engineering is asking for status updates every thirty minutes. A key client is affected.

Monday – 11:15 AM

Charlie (Backend) [11:15 AM]: Narrowed it down. A new rate-limit check is failing and blocking authentication requests. Investigating a fix.

Mark (DevOps) [11:18 AM]: We can manually clear blocked requests, but this is not a long-term solution. We need to patch the issue.

Priya (SRE) [11:20 AM]: Temporary fix deployed. Extended the connection timeout as a short-term measure. Users are still reporting issues.

Monday – 12:45 PM

Charlie (Backend) [12:45 PM]: Pushed a hotfix. The faulty rate-limit check has been disabled. Authentication traffic appears to be returning to normal. Can someone confirm?

Priya (SRE) [12:50 PM]: Metrics are stabilizing. Logins are gradually increasing. It looks good so far.

Samantha (Product) [12:55 PM]: Customer support confirms logins are working for most users. Some clients are still reporting intermittent failures.

Monday – 3:30 PM

Priya (SRE) [3:30 PM]: Declaring the incident resolved. Postmortem scheduled for Wednesday. Thanks to everyone for their work.

Slack Direct Messages – Leadership Updates
(DM between VP of Engineering and CTO)

VP of Engineering [10:20 AM]: I saw the alerts. What is the current status?

CTO [10:22 AM]: The authentication service is down. Root cause appears to be a recent change to the rate-limiting logic that is blocking logins.

VP of Engineering [10:25 AM]: What is the impact?

CTO [10:28 AM]: High impact. All users affected. The team is actively working on a resolution.

VP of Engineering [11:30 AM]: Do we have an estimated time for resolution?

CTO [11:35 AM]: A temporary fix is in place, but the issue is not fully resolved. Investigating a permanent patch now.

VP of Engineering [12:50 PM]: Any updates?

CTO [12:55 PM]: A hotfix has been deployed. Authentication traffic is returning to normal. We are monitoring the situation.

VP of Engineering [3:00 PM]: Understood. I expect a full postmortem and an action plan to prevent this in the future.

CTO [3:05 PM]: Agreed. We will include next steps in the postmortem report.



PR's To Change:
public boolean isRateLimited(String userId) {
    long requestCount = requestTracker.getRequestCount(userId);
    
    // Incorrect condition: blocks all requests instead of only excessive ones
    if (requestCount >= RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
After (Hotfix)

// Temporary fix: Ensure the rate-limit check only blocks excessive requests
public boolean isRateLimited(String userId) {
    long requestCount = requestTracker.getRequestCount(userId);
    
    if (requestCount > RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD) {  // Fixed: changed `>=` to `>`
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
📌 PR Summary:

Bug: A faulty rate-limit check was incorrectly blocking all authentication requests.
Fix: Adjusted the condition to only block users exceeding the limit.
Impact: Auth service is now functioning correctly.
PR 2: Improved Logging for Authentication Failures
(Adding better logs to help diagnose future authentication issues.)

Before

def authenticate_user(user_id, password):
    if not is_valid_user(user_id):
        return None  # No logging, making it hard to debug failures
    if not check_password(user_id, password):
        return None
    return generate_token(user_id)
After

import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def authenticate_user(user_id, password):
    if not is_valid_user(user_id):
        logger.warning(f"Authentication failed: Unknown user {user_id}")
        return None
    if not check_password(user_id, password):
        logger.warning(f"Authentication failed: Incorrect password for user {user_id}")
        return None
    logger.info(f"User {user_id} authenticated successfully")
    return generate_token(user_id)
📌 PR Summary:

Enhancement: Added logging to capture failed authentication attempts.
Benefit: Easier debugging of auth failures and better visibility into login issues.
PR 3: Feature - API Rate-Limiting Improvements
(Adding dynamic rate-limiting thresholds based on user role.)

Before

const RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD = 100; // Fixed limit for all users

function isRateLimited(userId) {
    const requestCount = requestTracker.getRequestCount(userId);
    return requestCount > RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD;
}
After

const RATE_LIMITS = {
    "admin": 500,
    "premium": 200,
    "standard": 100
};

function getUserRateLimit(userRole) {
    return RATE_LIMITS[userRole] || RATE_LIMITS["standard"];
}

function isRateLimited(userId, userRole) {
    const requestCount = requestTracker.getRequestCount(userId);
    return requestCount > getUserRateLimit(userRole);
