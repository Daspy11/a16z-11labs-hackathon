## Code structure

- The frontend uses Next.js. To run it, `cd frontend`, then `npm i`, then `npm run dev`
- The backend uses Flask and is configured with docker. To run it, you'll first need to create a .env in the backend folder containing [these environment variables](https://github.com/Daspy11/a16z-11labs-hackathon/blob/main/backend/config.py). To start it, run `cd backend` then `docker-compose up`

The voice agent configuration and prompting we used has been lost to the sands and constraints of time.
